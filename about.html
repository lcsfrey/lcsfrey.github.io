                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p> Highly motivated, polite, hardworking student who can apply himself to a variety of tasks with minimal fuss and enjoys learning new things. I put my all into any problem that is thrown at me but am not afraid to admit when I don't know something.
                    Looking for internships in the fields of software engineering, computer vision, and machine learning. My goal is to someday help develop technology that is substantially beneficial to humanity. Specifically, I want to work on projects that improve the quality and longevity of life or develop clean energy. For example, I have a lot of interest in technologies such as self-driving cars and machine learning applied to medical diagnostics. I believe these fields have amazing potential to improve our society.
