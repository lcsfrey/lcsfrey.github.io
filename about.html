                <p>
                    For my entire life, I have wanted to make a lasting positive impact on the world. 
                    I have wanted to help the world in conquering some of its greatest challenges by reducing the suffering of others wherever possible. 
                    The best way I can do that is by helping to eradicate some of the worlds most horrific diseases or by advancing the development of autonomous vehicles. 
                    Machine learning has and will continue to profoundly impact many facets of society.
